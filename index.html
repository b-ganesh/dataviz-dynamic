            Given the differences in gun laws across states, people often traffic guns across state lines.
            This graphic shows those movements using coral lines to indicate origin/destination paths.

            For example, we can see that guns flow from Arizona to almost every other state in the U.S. The
            solid line shows that California receives the highest percent (almost 19%) of guns purchased in
            Arizona.

            Similarly, 19% of the guns purchased in Indiana end up in the neighboring state of Illinois.
            Illinois has six times the number of gun laws when compared to Indiana.

            Finally, hovering over each of the states, it is possible to see the path of guns from that state
            to another state in the U.S. The large amount of trafficking across states suggests that state
            level measures may not be enough to curb the number of gun purchases in America.
